#Resource Request Service

Service That Allows Users To Request Approval For Cloud Resources To Be Created


###Current Work

- User Wants To Create Cloud Resource (EC2 Instance)
- User logs into Management Portal Clicks On 'Request Resource Creation'
- User fills in information about resource that they need created
- User submits request, request gets sent to 'supervisor'
- Supervisor reviews request and either approves or denies
- User is notified of approval/denial and either makes changes or continues to create resource


###Future Work

- After approval cloud resource automatically gets created for user with submitted data
